# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** July 19, 2026

ShalomFlow is a free, open-source desktop voice assistant for Windows, macOS, and
Linux. It is designed to be **local-first**: your voice is processed on your own
computer, and the app works without an account, sign-in, or any tracking.

This policy explains, in plain language, exactly what does and does not leave
your device. If anything here is unclear, please open an issue on our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/AbhishekBarali/SpeakoFlow).

---

## The short version

- **We do not collect any of your data.** ShalomFlow has no analytics, no
  telemetry, no tracking, no advertising, and no user accounts.
- **Your voice is transcribed on your device** and is never uploaded to us or to
  anyone else.
- **We do not operate any servers that receive your content.** There is no
  "ShalomFlow cloud."
- The app only makes a network connection in a few clearly-defined situations,
  described below — and the features that send your content to a third party are
  **off by default** and only ever use a provider **you** choose and configure.

---

## Information ShalomFlow does **not** collect

We want to be explicit, because "we don't collect data" is easy to say and
harder to prove. ShalomFlow contains **no** analytics or telemetry libraries and
sends **no** usage data, crash reports, device identifiers, or behavioral data to
the developer. Specifically, we never collect or transmit to ourselves:

- Your voice recordings or transcripts
- The text you dictate or paste
- Your conversations with the AI assistant
- Screenshots or screen contents
- Your API keys or credentials
- Your settings, personal memory, or history
- Any identifier, IP-based profile, location, or usage statistics

We could not sell or share this data even if we wanted to, because we never
receive it.

---

## Data that stays on your device

The following is stored **locally on your computer** and never sent to us:

- **Voice recordings and transcripts.** Recordings are saved in the app's local
  recordings folder so you can review or replay them, subject to your retention
  settings. You can delete them at any time from the History screen.
- **Speech-to-text processing.** Transcription runs entirely on your machine
  (on your CPU or GPU) using local models. Your audio never leaves the device for
  transcription.
- **Transcription history** and any "Flow" generations.
- **Personal memory** (an optional feature that is **off by default**): notes the
  assistant learns about how you like to work. It is stored on-device, fully
  viewable and editable by you, and can be exported or erased in
  Settings → Memory. It is never uploaded to us.
- **Settings and preferences.**
- **API keys and secrets.** Any keys you enter for third-party providers are
  stored in your operating system's secure credential store (the OS keychain /
  Credential Manager / Secret Service), not in plain-text config files, and never
  in logs.

## Optional network connections

ShalomFlow connects to the internet only in the situations below. Some are
standard app maintenance; the ones that send your content are **optional,
off by default, and routed to a provider you choose** — never through us.

### 1. Automatic update check
To tell you when a new version is available, the app checks a file published on
our GitHub Releases page. This is a normal file download; as with any web
request, the server (GitHub) can see your IP address and general request
metadata. No personal data is sent by ShalomFlow. You can ignore or disable
update checks in Settings.

### 2. Downloading models and engines
When you choose to download a speech, language, or voice model, ShalomFlow
fetches the model file from its host — typically Hugging Face, or a mirror on
GitHub. The local AI engine (llama.cpp) may likewise be fetched from GitHub. These
are plain file downloads of publicly available software; no personal data or
content is sent, though the host can see your IP address like any download.

### 3. The AI assistant and AI cleanup (optional)
If you use the assistant or the AI text-cleanup feature, your message (and
conversation context) is sent to the **model provider you have configured**. You
control which provider that is:
- a **fully offline, built-in model** that runs on your machine (nothing leaves
  your device), or
- a **local server** you run (e.g. Ollama or LM Studio), or
- a **cloud provider you choose** (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, OpenRouter,
  and others) using **your own API key**.

ShalomFlow does not proxy or copy this traffic — it goes directly from your
machine to the provider you selected. What that provider does with the data is
governed by **their** privacy policy.

### 4. Screen vision (optional, on request)
When you explicitly ask the assistant about your screen, ShalomFlow captures a
screenshot and includes it with that request to your chosen AI provider. It only
captures when you ask, and — like all assistant traffic — it goes only to the
provider you configured. If you use the offline built-in model, the screenshot
never leaves your device.

### 5. Text-to-speech (optional)
If you have spoken replies enabled, the assistant's answer text is converted to
audio either **locally** (the built-in Kokoro voice) or by a **TTS provider you
choose** (e.g. an OpenAI-compatible service, ElevenLabs, or Azure) using your own
key. Only the answer text needed to synthesize speech is sent to that provider.

### 6. Web search (optional, off by default)
If you enable web search, the assistant can send a search query to the **search
provider you configure** (e.g. Serper, Brave, Tavily, Exa, SerpAPI, or TinyFish) using your
own key, to fetch current information. This is off until you turn it on.

---

## Third-party providers

The optional cloud features above rely on services you choose and authenticate
with your own credentials. ShalomFlow is not affiliated with these providers and
has no visibility into the data you exchange with them. When you use such a
service, its own terms and privacy policy apply. If you prefer that nothing ever
leaves your machine, you can run ShalomFlow with only local models and keep every
optional cloud feature disabled.

## Children's privacy

ShalomFlow is a general-purpose productivity tool and is not directed at
children. We do not knowingly collect information from anyone, including
children.

## Security

API keys are stored in your operating system's secure credential store rather
than in plain-text files, and are never written to logs. Because your content is
processed locally and not stored on any server we control, there is no central
database of user data that could be breached. As with any software, keep your
operating system and ShalomFlow up to date.

## Open source

ShalomFlow is open source under the MIT license. You can inspect exactly what the
app does — including every network call — in the source code at
<https://github.com/AbhishekBarali/SpeakoFlow>.

## Changes to this policy

If this policy changes, we will update the "Effective date" above and publish the
updated version in the repository. Because the project is versioned in Git, the
full history of this document is publicly visible.
