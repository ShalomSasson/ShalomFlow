//! Remote TTS engines for the assistant's spoken summaries.
//!
//! Two engines are handled here in Rust (audio fetched and played natively
//! via rodio, so playback works even when the panel webview is hidden):
//! - "openai": any OpenAI-compatible `/audio/speech` endpoint — OpenAI,
//!   Azure OpenAI (`https://{res}.openai.azure.com/openai/v1` or
//!   `cognitiveservices.azure.com/openai/v1`, model = deployment name),
//!   Groq, LocalAI, Kokoro-FastAPI, openai-edge-tts, etc.
//! - "elevenlabs": ElevenLabs `text-to-speech/{voice_id}` API.
//! - "azure": Azure AI Speech (Neural TTS) `cognitiveservices/v1` SSML API —
//!   base URL is the regional TTS endpoint
//!   (`https://{region}.tts.speech.microsoft.com`), auth via the
//!   `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header, voice = a neural voice name such as
//!   `en-US-JennyNeural`. This is distinct from Azure OpenAI (use "openai"
//!   for `*.openai.azure.com` / `*.cognitiveservices.azure.com/openai/v1`).
//!
//! The "kokoro" engine runs fully locally in the panel webview
//! (kokoro-js, WebGPU) and never reaches this module.
