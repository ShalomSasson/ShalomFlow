//! "Generate with Flow" — the spoken-command generation path.
//!
//! When the feature is enabled and a normal dictation begins with the
//! configured activation phrase (default "Hey Flow"), the rest of the
//! dictation becomes a one-shot generation command. The finished result is
//! pasted into the active application instead of the spoken words.
//!
//! Design constraints (see the feature spec):
//! - Stateless: no assistant history, personas, memory, or response-length
//!   settings participate. One system prompt + the spoken command, per turn.
//! - Same model: reuses the assistant's provider/model/key — no second
//!   provider configuration.
//! - All-or-nothing: the caller pastes only a successful, non-empty result.
//!   Errors, timeouts, and empty output paste nothing.
//! - Optional screen access: when `flow_screen_access` is on, the model may
//!   call a `capture_screen` tool once per command; the model decides whether
//!   the command actually needs it.
