// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Secret handling (OS keychain)
//
// API keys live in the OS keychain (see `crate::secret_store`), not in
// `settings_store.json`. The flow:
//   * `write_settings` mirrors the in-memory secrets into the keychain, then
//     blanks them before the struct is written to disk.
//   * `get_settings` re-fills the in-memory secrets from the keychain so every
//     existing read site keeps working unchanged.
//   * `load_or_create_app_settings` performs a one-time migration of any
//     pre-existing plaintext keys out of the store and into the keychain.
// When the keychain is unavailable (e.g. headless Linux), secrets simply stay
// in the store and the app behaves exactly as before (a warning is logged once
// by `secret_store`).
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// Persist the in-memory secrets into the OS keychain and blank each one in the
/// struct **only after** the keychain confirms it holds the value. A failed
/// keychain write therefore leaves the key in the on-disk store as a fallback
/// rather than losing it. An empty value removes any stored credential, so
/// clearing a key in the UI actually clears it (and it won't be re-hydrated).

/// `write_settings` since every caller goes through `get_settings` first.
