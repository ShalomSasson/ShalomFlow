.SYNOPSIS
  Downloads the official llama.cpp server (the built-in LLM engine) so you can
  test the "Built-in (Local)" assistant provider locally.

.DESCRIPTION
  ShalomFlow's built-in LLM runs a small `llama-server` engine in the
  background. In production this binary is bundled in the installer; for local
  development you fetch it once with this script.

  The script downloads the latest llama.cpp Windows build from GitHub, extracts
  it, and prints the exact command to launch the app pointing at it.

.PARAMETER Backend
  Which build to download: "vulkan" (default, GPU on most machines),
  "cpu" (works everywhere, slower), or "cuda" (NVIDIA only).

.EXAMPLE
  ./scripts/setup-llm-engine.ps1
  ./scripts/setup-llm-engine.ps1 -Backend cpu
#>
param(
    [ValidateSet("vulkan", "cpu", "cuda")]
    [string]$Backend = "vulkan"
)
