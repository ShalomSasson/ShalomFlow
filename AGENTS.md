## Graphify policy

The project graph in `graphify-out/` is an optional architecture aid, not routine task machinery. Use focused `graphify query`, `graphify path`, or `graphify explain` commands for broad dependency and cross-feature questions, but read current source files before editing and stop using the graph if the first result is irrelevant.

Do **not** run `graphify update .` after ordinary changes. Refresh only when the user explicitly asks, when roughly 10 or more meaningful hand-written source files changed across at least two major subsystems, when module/dependency/IPC boundaries changed, or when a dedicated architecture review needs a current snapshot. Exclude locales, generated files, build output, formatting, documentation, test-only changes, and Graphify output from the threshold. Localized features should normally skip refreshes.

When justified, refresh once at the very end after validation. Never refresh more than once per task/session, never refresh for steering-only edits, and skip when uncertain. The full `/graphify` semantic rebuild requires an explicit user request.

## Architecture Overview

ShalomFlow is a cross-platform desktop voice assistant (dictation, AI chat panel, screen vision, and a local-first personal memory) built with Tauri 2.x (Rust backend + React/TypeScript frontend). It started as a fork of [Handy](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy) by CJ Pais; the local dictation core (Whisper/Parakeet pipeline, VAD, overlay, settings architecture) traces back to that project. See [README.md](README.md#credits--license) for full attribution.

### Backend Structure (src-tauri/src/)

- `lib.rs` - Main entry point, Tauri setup, manager initialization
- `managers/` - Core business logic:
  - `audio.rs` - Audio recording and device management
  - `model.rs` - Model downloading and management: resilient downloads that auto-retry with exponential backoff and resume from a `.partial` file via HTTP `Range` (`attempt_download`, `AttemptOutcome`, `HttpStatusError` sorting transient vs. permanent failures), plus an ordered source list — a reliable mirror first, the canonical Hugging Face URL as fallback (`download_candidates` / `mirror_url_for`; mirrors not yet populated)
  - `transcription.rs` - Speech-to-text processing pipeline. Compute-device enumeration is crash-isolated on Linux: `PROBE_DEVICES_OUT_OF_PROCESS` (true only on Linux) sends `cached_gpu_devices` / `cached_transcribe_cpp_devices` through `probe_devices_out_of_process`, which spawns `self --probe-devices` and parses one line of JSON. The vendored, statically linked whisper.cpp/ggml in `transcribe-rs` is built with ggml's default `GGML_NATIVE=ON` (`-march=native`), so loading its Vulkan backend can raise SIGILL when a package runs on a narrower CPU than the one that built it — out of process, that costs a GPU listing instead of the whole app at launch. Windows/macOS keep the in-process call unchanged
  - `history.rs` - Transcription history storage
- `audio_toolkit/` - Low-level audio processing:
  - `audio/` - Device enumeration, recording, resampling
  - `vad/` - Voice Activity Detection (Silero VAD)
- `commands/` - Tauri command handlers for frontend communication
- `cli.rs` - CLI argument definitions (clap derive)
- `shortcut/mod.rs` - Global keyboard shortcut handling (two engines: `handy-keys` and the Tauri global-shortcut plugin). Both engines route through the shared `shortcut/handler.rs::handle_shortcut_event`, which strips the `.lock` suffix and resolves the recording mode via `transcription_coordinator::recording_mode`. Every recording shortcut (dictation, dictation + post-processing, and the assistant) follows the single `push_to_talk` setting: on means hold to record, off means tap to start and tap to stop. Each recording shortcut also has an auto-derived Shift variant whose binding id carries a `.lock` suffix; that variant requests the **opposite** mode, so Shift plus your record combo gives you a hands-free recording while `push_to_talk` is on. The mid-recording tap-to-lock gesture was removed in favor of this simpler model (`lock_watch.rs` and `TapToLock.tsx` are leftovers with no live call sites). It also routes the cancel/`Esc` binding to either an active recording or a busy assistant reply
- `settings.rs` - Application settings management (recent additions: `sound_theme`; the experimental AI-Correction fields `post_process_enabled` / `post_process_tone` / `post_process_timeout_secs`; and the `experimental_enabled` gate that hides in-development features)
- `secret_store.rs` - API keys in the OS keychain (`keyring`), hydrated into settings on load
- `assistant.rs` - Assistant turn pipeline (`run_assistant_turn`): LLM chat, screen vision, profiles/personas, per-profile response-length. Runs a bounded tool-calling loop (`llm_client::send_chat_stream_with_tools`, `tool_choice = "auto"`, max ~3 rounds) exposing `assistant_tool_defs()` — the `web_search` and `get_current_datetime` tools — so the model itself decides when to search. Injects the advisory personal-memory block late in the prompt and triggers offline memory distillation when a conversation ends
- `memory.rs` - Local-first personal memory: a two-tier profile (always-on "About You" summary + durable notes) selected by keyword relevance within a per-turn token budget, learned via offline distillation at the end of a conversation, with safety guardrails (no secrets/PII, no instruction-shaped text, advisory-only) plus consolidation/decay/pruning
- `screenshot.rs` - Screen capture for vision: grabs the monitor under the mouse cursor (`capture_screen_data_url_at`, multi-monitor aware), adaptively JPEG-compresses to the provider's payload budget, and builds the small persisted display thumbnails (`data_url_to_thumbnail`)
- `llm_client.rs` - Shared OpenAI-compatible chat client used by the assistant, post-processing, and remote TTS: SSE streaming, tool-calling (the web-search path), structured/JSON-schema output, model listing, provider auth (Anthropic `x-api-key`, Azure `api-key`, OpenRouter `HTTP-Referer`/`X-Title`), Azure base-URL normalization to `/openai/v1`, and system-prompt folding for the built-in local engine (Gemma-style templates that reject a `system` role)
- `tts.rs` - Spoken answers (Kokoro local / OpenAI-compatible / ElevenLabs / Azure AI Speech)
- `web_search.rs` - Optional web search, fully model-decided: the assistant calls a `web_search` tool and `run_tool_search` turns the tool args into a one-query `SearchPlan` fed to `search_with_plan` (parallel snippet search + local rerank) — there is no separate planner or keyword heuristic. Six snippet-only backends (Serper default, Brave, Tavily, Exa, SerpAPI, TinyFish); a `WEB_SEARCH_CAPABILITY_NOTE` is folded into the system prompt when search is enabled. OpenRouter's server-side `:online` search is the one opt-in exception for OpenRouter users
- `transcription_coordinator.rs` - Single-threaded recording state machine; also owns `recording_mode`, which maps the `push_to_talk` setting plus the `.lock` variant flag onto `Hold` or `Lock`
- `actions.rs` - Post-recording output pipeline: pastes the transcript and runs the optional, experimental **AI Correction** post-processing pass (`post_process_transcription`, `resolve_post_process_provider_and_model`, `prewarm_builtin_llm`) — cleanup plus a tone directive (`PostProcessTone::directive()`) in a single LLM call, wrapped in `tokio::time::timeout(post_process_timeout_secs)` and falling back to the raw transcription on timeout or failure
- `overlay.rs` - Recording overlay window (platform-specific)
- `audio_feedback.rs` - Feedback-sound playback with selectable themes (`SoundTheme`: Default/Marimba/Pop/Click/Custom, resolved per start/stop from bundled resources), a `SoundType::Lock` cue that is currently unreachable (it belonged to the removed mid-recording lock gesture), and `play_test_sound` for in-settings previews
- `signal_handle.rs` - `send_transcription_input()` reusable function
- `utils.rs` - Platform detection helpers

### Frontend Structure (src/)

The app ships three Vite entry points: the main settings window (`App.tsx`), the
floating assistant panel (`assistant/`), and the recording overlay (`overlay/`).

- `App.tsx` - Main settings window: renders the custom `TitleBar`, the sidebar, and the active section (also drives the onboarding flow)
- `components/` - React UI components:
  - `TitleBar.tsx` - Custom window chrome (brand wordmark + minimize/close). The native chrome is disabled in `lib.rs`, so this bar also acts as the drag region; macOS keeps native traffic lights via an overlay title bar
  - `Sidebar.tsx` - Section navigation rail (`SECTIONS_CONFIG` defines the sections: general, models, advanced, history, post-processing, assistant, characters, memory, debug, about). The `characters` section is labeled "Profiles" in the UI; the internal key stays `characters` so code and locale keys don't churn
  - `settings/` - Settings UI, one folder/section (`general/`, `advanced/`, `history/`, `assistant/`, `models/`, `post-processing/`, `debug/`, `about/`) plus shared row components. The `memory` and `characters`/Profiles sections both live under `assistant/` (`MemorySettings.tsx`, `CharactersSettings.tsx`)
  - `model-selector/` - Model management interface
  - `onboarding/` - First-run setup wizard: a two-step flow (`OnboardingLayout.tsx` chrome + segmented "Step N of total" progress) — Step 1 picks a speech-to-text model (`Onboarding.tsx`), Step 2 optionally downloads a local assistant LLM in the background (`LlmOnboarding.tsx`), pointing the built-in provider at the model only once the file is on disk
  - `ui/` - Shared primitives; `ui/tones.ts` defines the semantic icon-tile / pill color tones (`SettingTone`, `TONE_TILE`, `TONE_PILL`) used by the iOS-style setting rows
  - `footer/`, `icons/` - Footer and icon components
- `assistant/` - Floating always-on-top AI chat panel (own window): streaming chat, screen vision, TTS, collapse-to-pill, and inline image thumbnails (screen captures + attached images) with click-to-enlarge (`AssistantPanel.tsx`, `preview.tsx`)
- `hooks/useSettings.ts` - Settings state management hook
- `stores/settingsStore.ts` - Zustand store for settings
- `bindings.ts` - Auto-generated Tauri type bindings (via tauri-specta)
- `overlay/` - Recording overlay window entry point
- `lib/types.ts` - Shared TypeScript type definitions

### Key Architecture Patterns

**Manager Pattern:** Core functionality organized into managers (Audio, Model, Transcription) initialized at startup and managed via Tauri state.

**Command-Event Architecture:** Frontend → Backend via Tauri commands; Backend → Frontend via events.

**Pipeline Processing:** Audio → VAD → Whisper/Parakeet → Text output → Clipboard/Paste

**State Flow:** Zustand → Tauri Command → Rust State → Persistence (tauri-plugin-store)

**Custom Title Bar:** Native window decorations are disabled on Windows/Linux (`decorations(false)` in `lib.rs`); the webview draws the chrome via `TitleBar.tsx` (brand + minimize/close, which needs the `core:window:allow-minimize`/`allow-close` capabilities). macOS keeps the window decorated with an overlay title bar (`TitleBarStyle::Overlay` + `hidden_title`) so the native traffic lights still work. Close hides to the tray (see `on_window_event`).

**Paste Safety Net:** Synthetic-paste flows (`input.rs`) always release modifiers after a key combo, via `input::release_all_modifiers`, so an interrupted paste can never leave Ctrl/Shift/Alt/Cmd stuck "pressed" at the OS level.

**Personal Memory (local-first):** `memory.rs` maintains a two-tier profile — an always-on "About You" summary plus durable notes selected by keyword relevance within a per-turn character/token budget (the `MemoryDetail` dial: Light/Balanced/Detailed). `build_memory_block` appends an advisory, delimiter-wrapped block late in the prompt in `run_assistant_turn` (kept late so the earlier prefix stays cache-friendly). Learning ("distillation") runs OFF the hot path at the end of a conversation — when the panel is hidden (`hide_assistant_panel`), the conversation is cleared (`assistant_clear_conversation`), or the user clicks "Update memory" (`assistant_distill_memory_now`) — reusing the active assistant provider (which can be the fully-offline built-in engine). A `last_distilled_len` dirty-guard prevents redundant passes. Safety is layered: capture, consolidation, and injection all reject secrets/PII and instruction-shaped text (`is_sensitive`), injected memory never overrides the user's current message, and consolidation dedupes/merges (Jaccard overlap), decays stale low-confidence auto notes (~45 days), and prunes to a hard cap. Off by default; an Incognito toggle skips both use and learning for a conversation. It's all stored on-device in settings and fully user-editable/exportable in Settings → Memory.

**Screen Vision (capture timing + thumbnails):** `screenshot.rs` captures the monitor under the mouse cursor (`capture_screen_data_url_at`), so multi-monitor users get the screen they're actually working on, and adaptively JPEG-compresses to the provider's payload budget (verified against Azure's tight cap). The `VisionCaptureTiming` setting controls _when_ a voice turn grabs the screen: `Immediate` (default) stashes a frame at recording start (in `AssistantAction::start`) so it reflects what the user saw when they began, consumed by `run_voice_turn`; `OnSend` captures after transcription. Typed messages always capture on send. Every message stores small persisted display thumbnails (`ChatMessage.images`, built by `build_message_thumbnails`) shown inline in the panel and history with click-to-enlarge — only the full-resolution frame is sent to the model (once), and only the compact thumbnail persists.

### Technology Stack

**Core Libraries:**

- `whisper-rs` - Local Whisper inference with GPU acceleration
- `cpal` - Cross-platform audio I/O
- `vad-rs` - Voice Activity Detection
- `handy-keys` - Global keyboard shortcuts (supports modifier-only combos like `Ctrl+Super`); Tauri's global-shortcut plugin is the alternative engine, selected via the `keyboard_implementation` setting
- `rdev` - Low-level input access (cursor position / virtual input)
- `rubato` - Audio resampling
- `rodio` - Audio playback for feedback sounds

### Application Flow

1. **Initialization:** App starts minimized to tray, loads settings, initializes managers
2. **Model Setup:** First-run downloads preferred Whisper model (Small/Medium/Turbo/Large)
3. **Recording:** Global shortcut triggers audio recording with VAD filtering
4. **Processing:** Audio sent to Whisper model for transcription
5. **Output:** Text pasted to active application via system clipboard

### Settings System

Settings are stored using Tauri's store plugin with reactive updates:

- Keyboard shortcuts (configurable, supports push-to-talk)
- Audio devices (microphone/output selection)
- Model preferences (Small/Medium/Turbo/Large Whisper variants)
- Audio feedback and translation options

### Single Instance Architecture

The app enforces single instance behavior — launching when already running brings the settings window to front rather than creating a new process. Remote control flags (`--toggle-transcription`, etc.) work by launching a second instance that sends args to the running instance via `tauri_plugin_single_instance`, then exits.

## Internationalization (i18n)

All user-facing strings must use i18next translations. ESLint enforces this (no hardcoded strings in JSX).

**Adding new text:**

1. Add key to `src/i18n/locales/en/translation.json`
2. Use in component: `const { t } = useTranslation(); t('key.path')`

**File structure:**

```
src/i18n/
├── index.ts           # i18n setup
├── languages.ts       # Language metadata
└── locales/
    ├── en/translation.json  # English (source)
    ├── de/, es/, fr/, ja/, ru/, zh/, ...
    └── ...
```

For translation contribution guidelines, see [CONTRIBUTING_TRANSLATIONS.md](CONTRIBUTING_TRANSLATIONS.md).

## Code Style

**Rust:**

- Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` before committing
- Handle errors explicitly (avoid unwrap in production)
- Use descriptive names, add doc comments for public APIs

**TypeScript/React:**

- Strict TypeScript, avoid `any` types
- Functional components with hooks
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Path aliases: `@/` → `./src/`

## CLI Parameters

ShalomFlow supports command-line parameters on all platforms for integration with scripts, window managers, and autostart configurations.

**Implementation:** `cli.rs` (definitions), `main.rs` (parsing), `lib.rs` (applying), `signal_handle.rs` (shared logic)

| Flag                     | Description                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--toggle-transcription` | Toggle recording on/off on a running instance              |
| `--toggle-post-process`  | Toggle recording with post-processing on/off               |
| `--cancel`               | Cancel the current operation on a running instance         |
| `--start-hidden`         | Launch without showing the main window (tray icon visible) |
| `--no-tray`              | Launch without system tray (closing window quits the app)  |
| `--debug`                | Enable debug mode with verbose (Trace) logging             |

**Key design decisions:**

- CLI flags are runtime-only overrides — they do NOT modify persisted settings
- Remote control flags work via `tauri_plugin_single_instance`: second instance sends args, then exits
- `send_transcription_input()` in `signal_handle.rs` is shared between signal handlers and CLI

## Debug Mode

Access debug features: `Cmd+Shift+D` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+D` (Windows/Linux)

## Platform Notes

- **macOS**: Metal acceleration, accessibility permissions required for keyboard shortcuts
- **Windows**: Vulkan acceleration, code signing
- **Linux**: OpenBLAS + Vulkan, limited Wayland support, overlay uses GTK layer shell (disable with `SPEAKOFLOW_NO_GTK_LAYER_SHELL=1`)

## Troubleshooting

See the [Troubleshooting](README.md#troubleshooting) section in README.md.

## GitHub workflow for AI coding assistants

**MANDATORY. Before opening any PR or issue in this repo: you MUST read the relevant template file and follow it strictly.** That includes sections that look "ceremonial" — checklists, AI Assistance disclosures, "Human Written Description". A generic Summary/Test-plan layout is not acceptable.

- **Opening a PR:** If this repo has a `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, read it and follow it strictly, including sections that look "ceremonial" (checklists, AI Assistance disclosures, "Human Written Description"). If a section requires a human-written paragraph, leave a clear TODO placeholder and ask the human contributor to fill it in — do not invent their voice.
- **Opening an issue:** If this repo has `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`, pick the right template rather than a blank issue.
- **Translations:** Follow [CONTRIBUTING_TRANSLATIONS.md](CONTRIBUTING_TRANSLATIONS.md).
- **Full contributor workflow:** [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

**Commits:** Use conventional commit prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`). Focus the message on _why_, not _what_.
